# sleep-health-insights

Analyzing sleep and lifestyle patterns to extract meaningful health insights using R and data visualization.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Conducted during an internal internship project, this analysis draws inspiration from real-world health tech use cases (such as Fitbit).  
The goal was to explore the relationships between sleep quality, lifestyle habits, and health outcomes through a structured analytical process using R.

The data used for this project is confidential and cannot be publicly shared.

## 📌 Objectives

- 🗂️ Clean and prepare real-world health & lifestyle data  
- 📊 Visualize sleep and activity variables using `ggplot2`  
- 📈 Perform correlation and distribution analysis (sleep, stress, activity, BMI)  
- 📝 Deliver insights in a clear, structured report

---

## 📌 Tools & Skills

- **Languages**: R  
- **Libraries**: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `caret`, `rpart`  
- **Skills**: Data cleaning · Exploratory data analysis · Classification modeling · Data storytelling
