# sleep-health-insights

Analyzing sleep and lifestyle patterns to extract meaningful health insights using R and data visualization.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Conducted during an internal internship project, this analysis draws inspiration from real-world health tech use cases (such as Fitbit).  
The goal was to explore the relationships between sleep quality, lifestyle habits, and health outcomes through a structured analytical process using R.

The data used for this project is confidential and cannot be publicly shared.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- 🗂️ Clean and prepare real-world health & lifestyle data  
- 📊 Visualize sleep and activity variables using `ggplot2`  
- 📈 Perform correlation and distribution analysis (sleep, stress, activity, BMI)  
- 📝 Deliver insights in a clear, structured report

---

## 📌 Tools & Skills

- **Languages**: R  
- **Libraries**: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `caret`, `rpart`  
- **Skills**: Data cleaning · Exploratory data analysis · Classification modeling · Data storytelling

---

## 📂 Project Files

- `sleep_health_insights.R` — R script for data preparation, outlier detection, visualization & classification  
- `Sleep_Health_Insights_SheilaHoumey.pdf` — Final report including methodology, visualizations, and insights  
- `visuals/` — Contains the BMI category distribution plot  

> 📁 Note: The dataset used in this project is private and is **not included** in the repository.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### 1. Requirements

- **R** (version 4.2 or higher)
- Install required packages:
  ```r
  install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "caret", "rpart"))

### 2. Running in RStudio

- **R** (version 4.2 or higher)
- Open
  ```r
  sleep_health_insights.R
  
- Make sure the dataset is located at:
  ```r
  data/sleep_fitness_internal_dataset.csv
- Click **"Source"** or **Run** the script step by step
- Visuals will be saved to the **visuals/** folder
- ✨ Model accuracy and outputs will appear in the console

### 3. Running in Visual Studio Code

- Open the project folder in **VS Code**
- Use an **R extension**
- Open the integrated terminal and run:
  ```r
  R
  source("sleep_health_insights.R")
