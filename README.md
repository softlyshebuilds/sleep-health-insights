# sleep-health-insights

Analyzing sleep and lifestyle patterns to extract meaningful health insights using R and data visualization.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Inspired by health tech use cases like Fitbit, this project explores the relationships between sleep quality, lifestyle habits, and health outcomes using a public dataset.  
The goal was to uncover patterns and correlations through a structured analytical process using R.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- 🗂️ Clean and prepare raw data for analysis  
- 📊 Visualize sleep and lifestyle variables using `ggplot2`  
- 📈 Perform correlation analysis (stress, sleep, activity, BMI)  
- 📝 Deliver insights in a clear, structured report

---

## 📌 Tools & Skills

- **Languages**: R  
- **Libraries**: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tidyr`  
- **Skills**: Data cleaning · Exploratory data analysis · Data storytelling · Visual strategy
